# Run with MAXIMUM THROUGHPUT settings for thousands of concurrent requests
# Optimizations for API service:
# - workers 8 (handle massive concurrent load, 2x CPU cores)
# - worker-class gthread (better for I/O-bound crypto operations)
# - threads 4 (32 concurrent requests total: 8 workers × 4 threads)
# - timeout 60 (fast operations only, fail quickly)
# - max-requests 5000 (less frequent recycling for stability)
# - preload-app (faster startup, shared crypto constants)
# - worker-connections 1000 (high concurrency per worker)
# - backlog 2048 (large queue for burst traffic)
# - worker-tmp-dir /dev/shm (RAM-based temp storage)
