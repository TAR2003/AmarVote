A: Most elections require account creation for security and verification purposes. However, some public polls may allow anonymous participation. Check specific election requirements.

**Q: How do I know if I'm eligible to vote in an election?**
A: Election eligibility is set by the election administrator. You'll receive an invitation if you're eligible, or you can check the election details page for eligibility criteria.

**Q: Can I vote from multiple devices?**
A: You can access your account from multiple devices, but you can only vote once per election. The system prevents duplicate voting from the same account.

**Q: What if I forget my password?**
A: Use the "Forgot Password" link on the login page. You'll receive an email with instructions to reset your password. Make sure to check your spam folder.

### Voting Process Questions

A: This depends on the election settings. Some elections allow vote changes within the voting period, while others do not. Check the specific election rules.

**Q: How long does it take to vote?**
A: Most elections take 2-5 minutes to complete, depending on the number of candidates and complexity of the ballot. Review time may add additional minutes.

**Q: What if I accidentally close my browser while voting?**
A: Your progress is usually saved automatically. Log back in and navigate to the election to continue where you left off. If you encounter issues, contact support.

A: Result timing depends on election settings. Some show real-time results during voting, others release results only after voting closes and verification is complete.

**Q: How can I trust the election results?**
A: AmarVote provides cryptographic proofs of election integrity. Anyone can independently verify that the results are mathematically correct using public verification tools.

**Q: Are detailed voting statistics available?**
A: Many elections provide aggregate statistics about voter turnout, demographic breakdowns, and voting patterns. Individual vote choices remain private.
